Number Plate Detection

This project is a Python-based implementation of number plate detection for videos. 
It utilizes computer vision techniques to identify and locate license plates in a video stream. 
The implementation is based on OpenCV, a popular computer vision library in Python, and it uses Haar cascades for object detection. 
The algorithm first detects potential license plate regions in the video frames and then applies image processing techniques to extract the license plate characters. 
Finally, the extracted characters are recognized using optical character recognition (OCR).
It can also be used for research in computer vision and machine learning.
The code is well-documented and easy to use. It requires only a few modifications to work with different video sources. 
The GitHub repository also includes sample videos and test scripts to help users get started.
